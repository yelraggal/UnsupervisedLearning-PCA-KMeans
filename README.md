Key aspects of the project include:
1. Implementation of K-Means and PCA using NumPy.
2. Conducting two experiments:
   - First experiment: Clustering the dataset using K-Means.
   - Second experiment: Applying PCA followed by clustering using K-Means.
3. Utilizing the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters in both experiments and comparing the sum of square errors/distances.
4. Experimenting with different numbers of principal components in the second experiment and visualizing the results compared to the original labels.
